>You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil of happiness has been taken away, and that now you're seeing truly. (抑郁者并不认为自己的眼前蒙上了一层灰色的轻纱，且他们在透过灰纱看这个世界。他们认为快乐的轻纱被撕走了，他们终于看到了真相。)

>It's a strange poverty of the English language, that we use this same word, depression, to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday, and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide. (不要仅仅因为我们贫乏的语言中，把一个孩子生日下雨的感受和一个人自杀前的感受用同一个词描述，就误以为它们是相似的)

>The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality. (抑郁的反面不是快乐，而是生命力)

这个演讲告诉我们：抑郁者往往不是被幻想控制，反而，他们抑郁的根基论断（对存在性问题的悲观回答）在某种层面上是正确的，也有整个逻辑自洽的推理体系。不同的是，非抑郁者要么不被这些存在性问题分心，要么在考虑这些问题时会带入一点偏向积极的非理性因素，因此不会轻易向消极的推理方向走。换句话说，为了证明自己的世界观体系是正确的，抑郁者必须已经相信一个最根本的假设：“我”的理性是全知全能的。就是在这里，他们错了。（这也是为什么那些看起来不可能抑郁的人————往往比较自信，有批判性思维————会抑郁）

现在你知道“正确”，“确信”，“certainty”这类感受在一段抑郁经历中是多么重要的角色了。

为了自我治愈，反驳这个根基假设，抑郁者必须明白以下两点：
- 1.人的理性不是全知全能的
- 2.“我”的理性和其他“人”相比，并没有本质的优越

因此，自我治愈抑郁（心理治愈）的一个有效途径是*自我质疑*和*保持谦逊*————
> 如果那些快乐乐观的人所相信的美好的世界观有可能是错的，那么我那些悲观的、一环扣一环、看起来符合逻辑的信念也有可能是错的。为了这个不辨真伪的东西牺牲我的精力和生命力，真的值得吗？如果一意孤行地不改变看法，那么就是我的自负导致了这一切损失。不可以这样。

至此，抑郁者就完成了从沼泽中把自己拔出来的过程。（当然啦完全恢复还要辅以饮食调节，睡眠调节，运动等）

从抑郁的状态中恢复是两者的结合：心理治愈和生理治愈。如果抑郁严重到已经改变大脑模式，可以通过终生规律服药达到生理治愈；但是要完全过上和正常人别无二致的生活，心理治愈不可或缺。

>Valuing one's depression does not prevent a relapse, but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself easier to tolerate. The question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful. It's of seeking that meaning and thinking, when it comes again, "This will be hellish, but I will learn something from it." I have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be, how it can be more real than facts, and I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way. The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and these days, my life is vital, even on the days when I'm sad. I felt that funeral in my brain, and I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world, and I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul that I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit.


#### 作者对于自己经历的回忆和对抑郁感受的精确描述

But in 1994, three years later, I found myself losing interest in almost everything. I didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do, and I didn't know why. The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality. And it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment. Everything there was to do seemed like too much work. I would come home and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine, and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends, I would think, "What a lot of people that is to have to call back." Or I would decide I should have lunch, and then I would think, but I'd have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it and swallow it, and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross.

And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it's ridiculous. You know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it. You know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door and that it's not a big deal, and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it. And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less. It was a kind of nullity.

And then the anxiety set in. If you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month, I would say, "As long I know it'll be over in November, I can do it." But if you said to me, "You have to have acute anxiety for the next month," I would rather slit my wrist than go through it. It was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if you're walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you, but instead of lasting half a second, the way that does, it lasted for six months. It's a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of. And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive, and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people.

One of the first people I interviewed described depression as a slower way of being dead, and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness, that this is a serious business. It's the leading disability worldwide, and people die of it every day.

...

So now people say, "You take these happy pills, and do you feel happy?" And I don't. But I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch, and I don't feel sad about my answering machine, and I don't feel sad about taking a shower. I feel more, in fact, I think, because I can feel sadness without nullity. I feel sad about professional disappointments, about damaged relationships, about global warming. Those are the things that I feel sad about now. And I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion? How did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through? What is the mechanism of resilience?


#### 关于depression的误解

There are three things people tend to confuse: depression, grief and sadness. Grief is explicitly reactive. If you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy, and then, six months later, you are still deeply sad, but you're functioning a little better, it's probably grief, and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure. If you experience a catastrophic loss, and you feel terrible, and six months later you can barely function at all, then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances. The trajectory tells us a great deal. People think of depression as being just sadness. It's much, much too much sadness, much too much grief at far too slight a cause.

People say to me, "Well, is it continuous with normal sadness?" And I say, in a way it's continuous with normal sadness. There is a certain amount of continuity, but it's the same way there's continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot that you have to sand off and do a little repainting, and what happens if you leave the house for 100 years and it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust. And it's that orange dust spot, that orange dust problem, that's the one we're setting out to address.


#### 抑郁经历的本质

You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness, and that now you're seeing truly. It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised, but it's difficult with depressives, because we believe we are seeing the truth.

But the truth lies. I became obsessed with that sentence: "But the truth lies." And I discovered, as I talked to depressive people, that they have many delusional perceptions. People will say, "No one loves me." And you say, "I love you, your wife loves you, your mother loves you." You can answer that one pretty readily, at least for most people. But people who are depressed will also say, "No matter what we do, we're all just going to die in the end." Or they'll say, "There can be no true communion between two human beings. Each of us is trapped in his own body." 

A lot of the time, what they are expressing is not illness, but insight, and one comes to think what's really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don't distract us very much. There was a study I particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of non-depressed people were asked to play a video game for an hour, and at the end of the hour, they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed. The depressive group was usually accurate to within about 10 percent, and the non-depressed people guessed between 15 and 20 times as many little monsters -- as they had actually killed.


#### 最后，一个抑郁者也可以拥有对生命的热爱

I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again, I've found a way to love my depression. I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy. I love it because each day I decide, sometimes gamely, and sometimes against the moment's reason, to cleave to the reasons for living. And that, I think, is a highly privileged rapture.
