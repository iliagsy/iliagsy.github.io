title: 0320-特朗普时代的外交政策

Many people *find reassurance in* the sober, capable military men who surround him. His chief of stuff, his defence secretary and his national security advisor all understand the horror of war and will stop him from doing anything rash, the argument goes.

Optimists even *speculate* that he might emulate Ronald Reagen, by shaking up the diplomatic establishment, restoring America's military muscle and projecting such strength abroad that a frightened, over-stretched North Korea will crumble like the Soviet Union.

Others confidently predict that even if he causes short-term damage to America's standing in the world, Mr. Trump will be voted out in 2020, and things will return to normal. All this is wishful thinking.

On security, Mr. Trump has avoided some terrible mistakes. He has not started a needless row with China over Taiwan's ambiguous status, as he once threatened to do.

Congress and the election-hacking scandal prevented him from pursuing a grand bargain with Vladmir Putin that might have left Russia's neighbours at Kremlin's mercy. And he has apparently coaxed China to exert a little more pressure on North Korea to stop expanding its nuclear arsenal.

However, he has made some serious errors, too, such as undermining削弱 the deal with Iran that *curbs* its ability to make nuclear bombs. And his instincts are atrocious残忍.

He imagines he has nothing to learn from history. He warms to strong men such as Mr. Putin and Xi Jinping. His love of generals *is matched by* a disdain for diplomats. He has *gutted* the states department, losing *busloads of* experienced ambassadors. His tweeting is no joke. He *undermines and contradicts* his officials without warning, and makes *reckless* threats agains Kim Jong Un, whose paranoia needs no stoking.

Perhaps the greatest damage that Mr. Trump has done is to American soft power. He openly scorns the

Not only does he admire dictators. He explicitly praises thuggishness, such as the mass murder of criminal suspects in the Phillipines. He does so apparently not out of diplomatic tact, but

Furthermore, Mr Trump has yet to be tested by a crisis. Level-headed generals may advise him, but he is the commander-in-chief, with a temperament that alarms friend and foe alike.

On trade he remains wedded to a zero-sum view of the world, in which exporters win and inporters lose.

Mr Trump has made clear that he favors bilateral deals over multilateral ones because that way a big country like America can bully small ones into making concessions. The trouble with this approach is twofold两方面.
