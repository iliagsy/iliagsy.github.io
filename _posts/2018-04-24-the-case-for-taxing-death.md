> How to balance people's desire to bequeath assets with the unfairness of inheritance?

No tax is popular. But one attracts particular _venom_. Inheritance tax is routinely seen as the least fair by the Britons and the Americans.

This _hostility_ _spans_ income brackets. Indeed, surveys suggest that opposition to inheritance and estate taxes (one levied on heirs and the other on legacies) is even stronger among the poor than the rich.

Politicians know a vote-winner when they see one. The estate of a dead adult American is 95% less likely to face tax now than in the 1960s.

And Republicans want to go all the way: the House of Representatives has passes a tax-reform plan that would completely abolish "death taxes" by 2025. For a time before the second world war, Britons were more likely to pay death duties than income tax; today less than 5% of estates catch the taxman's eye.

It is not just Anglo-Saxons. Revenue from these taxes in OECD countries, as a share of total government revenue, has fallen sharply since 1960s. Many other countries have gone down the same path.

In 2004, even the egalitarian Swedes decided that their inheritance tax should be abolished. Yet this trend towards _trifling_ or zero estate taxes ought to *give pause*.

Such levies pit 2 vital liberal principles against each other. One is that governments should leave people to dispose of their wealth as they see fit.

The other is that a permanent, *hereditary* elite makes a society unhealthy and unfair. How to choose between them?

Some people argue for a *punitive* inheritance tax. They start with the negative argument that dead people no longer enjoy the general freedom to disburse their wealth as they wish, as the dead have no rights. How could they, when they are not affected one way or the other by what happens in the world? That does not ring true.

The logic would be to *abrogate* even the most modest of wills. But inheritances are deeply personal, and the biggest single gift that many give to causes they believe in and loved ones they may have cherished.

Many living people would feel wronged if they could not provide for their children. If anything, as the expression of their last wishes, bequests carry more weight than their passing fancies do.

The positive argument for steep inheritance taxes is that they promote fairness and equality. Heirs have rarely done anything to deserve the money that comes their way.

Liberals, from John Stuart Mill to Theodore Roosevelt, thought that needed correcting. Roosevelt, who warned that letting huge fortunes pass across generations was of great and genuine detriment to the community at large, would doubtlessly be aghast at the situations today.

Annual flows of inheritance in France have tripled as a proportion of GDP since the 1950s. Half of Europe's billionaires have inherited their wealth and their number seems to be rising.
