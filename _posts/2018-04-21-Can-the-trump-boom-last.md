### Leaders - The American economy: Can the Trump boom last?

> America's president is not the architect of American strength. But in the short term, things will go his way.

### （1）

There is often more _fakery_ than truth in a tweet from President Donald Trump.
But on one subject he is broadly right. America's economy is in good shape.
Business confidence is high. Jobs are _plentiful_.

Last month non-farm companies added 228,000 workers to their payrolls. The unemployment rate is 4.1%, the lowest figure for more than a decade.

The availability of jobs is drawing more of the working-age population into the labour force. Wages are growing _in real terms_, with some of the biggest gains going to low-paid workers.

Mr. Trump over-eggs things, of course. He claims each good jobs report and each *new peak* in the S&P 500 as his own achievement.

In fact, he was *lucky in* his inheritance. The market has *risen* by 25% since his election, but *is up* by 195% since 2009.

The unemployment rate *fell from a peak of* 10% to 4.7% under Barak Obama and then to 4.1% on Mr. Trump's watch. His administration says that the mix of deregulation and corporate-tax cuts will *spur* *sustained GDP growth* of 3%, well above the 2% average of recent years.

As the economy approaches full employment, an *astonishing* _pickup_ in productivity would be neede to accomplish that. But Trump-bashes overstate their case too.

They dismiss the optimism of consumers and bosses as sentiment, not substance. They warn that the stock market if dangerously overvalued and that America's expansion, which is in its 102nd month, must soom _falter_.

### （2）
Yet the economy is not in *immediate danger*. And the maturity of the business cycle cuts both ways.

It makes a nonsense of Mr Trump's claims to be *the author of American economic success*. But the economy is also capable of some welcome surprises.

America is not the only economy doing well. For about a year, a *synchronised global expansion*, taking in Europe, Asia and Americas, has been *under way*.

GDP growth in the euro zone, a region until recently synonymous with economic misery, is around 2.5%, despite slower population growth than America's. But Ameirica stands out, because of where it is in the cycle.

If it continues in 2018, this expansion will become the country's second-longest ever. True, there are *perils*.

As the business cycle matures, there is more chance that the economy will overheat, because of the bottlenecks in the jobs market; or that the centural bank overtightens in order to prevent things from running too hot.

The longer the economy keeps growing, moreover, the more *scope* there is for financial inbalances, such as *excess* debt or _frothy_ asset prices, to build up. Some warning signals are flashing.

The gap between long-term and short-term interest rate has narrowed, as it tends to before recessions. Yet the evidence for overheating is thin.

Inflation has *trended lower* this year. Wage growth has *picked up* a little, thankfully, but shows few signs of accelarating.

Pay would have to increase by quite a lot more before rising inflation is a real worry.
