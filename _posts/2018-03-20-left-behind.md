> The right way to help places hurt by globalisation.

Populism's wave has yet to crest.

That is the sobering *lesson* of recent elections in Germany and Austria, where the success of anti-immigrant, anti-globalisation parties show that *a message of hostility* to elites and outsiders resonates有共鸣 as strongly as ever among those fed up with the status quo.

It is also the lesson from America where Donald Trump is *doubling down* on *gestures* to his angry *base*, most recently, by adopting a negotiating position on NAFTA that is more likely to *wreck* than to *remake* the trade agreement.

These remedies will not work. The *demise* of NAFTA will *disproportionately hurt* the blue-collar workers who back President Trump.

Getting tough on immigrants will do nothing to improve economic conditions in eastern Germany, where 20% of voters backed the far-right Alternative for Germany. But the *self-defeating* nature of populist policies will not blunt their appeal.

Mainstream parties must offer voters who feel left behind a better *vision of the future*, *one that* takes greater account of the geographical reality behind the politics of anger.

Economic theory suggests that *regional inequalities* should *diminish* as poorer (and cheaper) places attract investment and grow faster than richer ones. The 20th century bore that theory out. Income gaps *narrowed across* American states and European regions.

No longer. Affluent places are now pulling away from poorer ones.

This geographical divergence has dramatic consequences. A child born in the bottom 20% in wealthy San Francisco has twice as much chance as a similar child in Detroit of ending up in the top 20% as an adult.
